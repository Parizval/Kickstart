# Bike Tour

## Description

Li has planned a bike tour through the mountains of Switzerland. His tour consists of N checkpoints, numbered from 1 to N in the order he will visit them. The i-th checkpoint has a height of Hi.

A checkpoint is a peak if:

- It is not the 1st checkpoint or the N-th checkpoint, and

- The height of the checkpoint is strictly greater than the checkpoint immediately before it and the checkpoint immediately after it.

Please help Li find out the number of peaks
